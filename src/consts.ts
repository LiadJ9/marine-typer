  'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.',
  'It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.',
  'Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peoples hats off - then I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.',
  'Let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water.',
  'Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.',
  'But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape... What is the chief element he employs?',
  'Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.',
  'We ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.',
  'The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid - what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvelous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!',
  'As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.',
  'It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.',
  'Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.',
  'But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.',
  'Delight is to him - a far, far upward and inward delight - who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.',
  'But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.',
  'I have no objection to any persons religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person dont believe it also.',
  'And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath - O Father! - chiefly known to me by Thy rod - mortal or immortal, here I die.',
  'How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends.',
  'The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.',
  'It is not down in any map; true places never are.',
  'With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest.',
  'A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.',
  'So that there are instances among them of men, who, ... still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night‚Äëwatches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all natures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language-that man makes one in a whole nations census-a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.',

  'I have no objection to any persons religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person dont believe it also. But when a mans religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.',

  'In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.',

  'I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.',

  '"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomys meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lords day."',
  '"I dont know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."',
  '"Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with me - explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me."',
  'I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mothers son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.',
  '"Splice, thou meanst splice hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer. "Young man, youd better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon..."',
  'Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ships papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, well give ye the ninetieth lay, and thats more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.',

  'And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.',

  'Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commoners; bear me out in it, O God!',

  'Damn me, its worth a fellows while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, thats about the first thing babies do, and thats a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of em. But thats against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth - So here goes again.',
  'Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.',

  'For small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything.',

  'This it is, that for ever keeps Gods true princes of the Empire from the worlds hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.',

  'Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished.',
  "But what's this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale! art not game for Moby Dick?",
  "I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.",
  'All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby-Dick.',
  'What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.',
  'To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.',
  'Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.',
  'O Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies; not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.',
  'There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.',
  'Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic.',
  "Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book.",
  "Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.",
  'An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same - the same! - the same to Noah as to me.',
